# CS-303
This repo contains my lab solutions plus term project for the logic &amp; digital system design course

It has to be noted that on each lab we were given a base circuit, so we did not implement the whole solution but a part of it.

---

for the project, we had to design a BCD calculator that only does addition in Digital (the digital circuit design software). We were given a hex input pad where A,B,C and D were wrong inputs, E was clear and F was sum. we designed the data-path and controller parts of the circuit to achieve the target functionality. We also exported the project to verilog to run it on an FPGA board.

My teammate for this project was [hui423](https://github.com/hui423)
